# Intoduction

I'm guessing you've heard about mithril at some point,
if not, get out from that rock you've been living under.

The gist of it is that there's a new framework in town
and oh boy is it wiping the floor with your
friends Angular and React
in terms of rendering performance,
load time, redrawing, and more.

It achieves this by mapping HTML onto javascript,
in stead of going the other way round
(like those friends we discussed earlier).



# Hello World in mithril
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<script src="mithril.min.js"></script>
<script>
m.mount(document.body, {
    view: function () {
        return m('h1', 'Hello World!');
    }
});
</script>
```
Yes, this is valid HTML 5!
According to the specs, the `<html>`, `<head>`
and `<body>` tags can be omitted,
but their respective DOM elements will still be there
implicitly when a browser renders that markup.

I would like you to notice the absolute lack of
boilerplate code in this example. All you need to
do to start using mithril is include it in your page.

Compare this to Angular where in order to start you
need to first familiarize yourself with multiple
programming patterns (services, dependency injection, etc.)
and you wind up with one of the most newbie
friendly frameworks around. In fact, as you will come
to see while reading this book, you don't really need
to learn mithril as much as you need to learn javascript.

That being said this book will delve into some of the
best practices of mithril and give you some
very nice patterns to know and have in your repertoire.
